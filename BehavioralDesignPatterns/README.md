## **Behavoiral Design Patterns** 

*Concerned with the assignment of responsibilities between objects and how they communicate*

- Deals with the responsibilites of objects
- Helps objects cooperate
- Assign clear hierarchy
- Can encapsulate requests

### Observer Pattern

*Allows a collection of objects to watch an object and be notified of changes*

- Allows loose coupling
- One object is the focal point
- Group of object watch for changes
- Can be hefty

### Mediator Pattern

*Controls communication between objects so neither object has to be coupled to the others*

- Allows loose coupling
- One objecte manage all communication
- Many to many relationship
- Task pushes events to mediator

### Command Pattern

*Encapsulates the calling of a method as an object*

- Allows fully decoupling execution from the implementation
- Allows for less fragile implementations
- Supports undo operations
- Supports audting and logging of operations
